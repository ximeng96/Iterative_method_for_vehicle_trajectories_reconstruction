#  Method application with the NGSIM data
## Calibration with sample trajectories on freeways and urban arterials
To replicate the samples, the codes are available at "ite_method", and the data are available at "sample_data" or "raw_camera6". Note that due to the limitation of the file size in Github, these datasets only include part of the trajectories.  However, the entire NGSIM dataset can be used for testing our code, which can be downloaded at https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Vehicle-Trajector/8ect-6jqj. For the examples on the urban arterial, just load the corresponding dataset and input the vehicle id.

The code can also be tested via JupyterLite at
https://ximeng96.github.io/Iterative_method_for_vehicle_trajectories_reconstruction/lab/index.html. Open the file "ite_method" from the table of contents.

## Application to the NGSIM I80 dataset
The codes used for reconstructing the entire NGSIM I80 dataset are available at "ite_method_dataset". Note that the methodology part for the three .ipynb files are the same, and the differences are only about the application.

# The reconstructed data
The raw and the reconstructed data are avaliable at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FYWNbPQuTOqCty_ZennxOIpnavqGFk1F/view?usp=sharing and https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mWY1pUvvi6ZGzRkHZ7kMxJQkNfSDAWW3/view?usp=sharing
