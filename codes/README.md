#  Method application with the NGSIM data
## Calibration with sample trajectories on freeways and urban arterials
To replicate the samples, the codes are available at "ite_method", and the data are available at "sample_data". Note that due to the limitation of the file size in Github, "sample_data" only include part of the trajectories. However, the entire NGSIM dataset can also be used for testing our code, which can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xT_NrWLFTK_lhAM0glliogUXls1jkaqw.

The code can also be tested via JupyterLite at
https://ximeng96.github.io/Iterative_method_for_vehicle_trajectories_reconstruction/lab/index.html.Open the file "ite_method_examples" from the table of contents.

## Application to the NGSIM I80 dataset
The codes used for reconstructing the entire NGSIM I80 dataset are available at "ite_method_dataset". 

# The reconstructed data
The raw and the reconstructed data are avaliable at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5_ywtYxgo4tvalexLOxv_uUhuDZT2-Z/view?usp=sharing and https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bAtdnSZsqDBF75vP_fMb3r7LlabQR8lZ/view?usp=sharing
