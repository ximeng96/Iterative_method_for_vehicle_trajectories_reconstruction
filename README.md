# An iterative method for correcting and smoothing vehicle trajectories based on first principles

The dataset includes processed trajectory data of vehicles moving at the NGSIM I80 site during 4:00pm to 4:15pm. We focus on the longitudinal vehicle trajectories and offer an approach designed based on the basic principles of road traffic.
To replicate the samples, the codes are available at "content -> ite_method", and the data are available at 

Or the code can be tested via JupyterLite at
